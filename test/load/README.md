# Installing

```sh
brew install k6
npm install
```

You also need to have Google Chrome installed.

# Generating test script

Test scripts are (re-)generated by running a Cypress spec in Chrome, capturing a HAR file of all requests and converting them to a k6 script.

Execute this helper to run all steps in a single command:

```sh
./bin/generateTestScript.js
```

# Running tests

```sh
k6 run ./<script-name>.js
```
